You know my temp'rature's risin' and the jukebox blowin' a fuse, My heart's beatin' rhythm and my soul keeps asingin' the blues; Roll over Beethoven and tell Tchaikowsky the news.

Well, if you feel you like it, go get your lover, The reel and rock it, roll it over, Then move on up just a trifle further, The reel and rock with one another, roll over Beethoven, Dig these rhythm and blues.  Well, early in the mornin' and I'm givin' you my warnin', Don't you step on my blue suede shoes; Hey, diddle diddle, I'm a playin' my fiddle. Ain't got nothin' to lose; Roll over, Beethoven and tell Tchaikowsky the news.  You know she wiggles like a glow-worm, Dance like a spinnin' top, She got a crazy partner, You oughta see 'em reel and rock; Long as she's got a dime, the music won't ever stop.  Roll over, Beethoven, roll over Beethoven, Roll over, Beethoven, roll over Beethoven, Roll over, Beethoven and dig these rhythm and blues.

If you wanna dance with me.  'Way down South they gave a jubilee, The jokey folks they had a jamboree; They're drinkin' home brew from a water cup, The folks dancin' got all shook up.  And started playin' that Rock And Roll Music, Any old way you choose it; It's got a back beat, you can't lose it, Any old time you use it. It's gotta be rock roll music, If you wanna dance with me. If you wanna dance with me.  Don't care to hear 'em play a tango, I'm in the mood to hear a mambo; It's 'way too early for a congo, So keep a rockin' that piano. So I can hear some of that Rock And...

There are places I remember all my life, Though some have changed Some forever, not for better Some have gone, and some remain  All these places had their moments With lovers and friends I still can recall Some are dead and some are living In my life I've loved them all  But of all these friends and lovers There is no one compares with you, And these mem'ries lose their meaning When I think of love as something new  Though I know I'll never lose affection For people and things that went before, I know I'll often stop and think about them In my life I'll love you more  Though I know I'll never lose affection For people and things that went before, I know I'll often stop and think about them In my life I'll love you more In my life I'll love you more

I once had a girl or should I say she once had me She showed me her room isn't it good Norwegian wood? She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair  I sat on a rug biding my time Drinking her wine We talked until two and then she said It's time for bed She told me she worked in the morning And started to laugh I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath  And when I awoke I was alone This bird had flown So I lit a fire isn't it good Norwegian wood?

Ah, Look at all the lonely people. Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church Where a wedding has been Lives in a dream Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door. Who is it for? All the lonely people, where do they all come from All the lonely people, where do they all belong  Father Mckenzie, writing the words of a sermon that no-one will hear No-one comes near. Look at him working, darning his stocks in the night when the-re's nobody there. What does he care? All the lonely people, where do they all come from All the lonely people, where do they all belong  Ah, Look at all the lonely people. Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried a long with her name Nobody came. Father Mckenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave. No one was saved. All the lonely people, where do they all come from? (Ah - Look at all the lonely people) All the lonely people, where do they all belong? (Ah - Look at all the lonely people)
Your day breaks Your mind aches You find that all her words of kindness linger on when she no longer needs you She wakes up She makes up She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry She no longer needs you.  And in her eyes you see nothing No sign of love behind the tears cried For No One A love that should have lasted years. You want her You need her And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead you think she needs you And in her eyes you see nothing No sign of love behind the tears cried For No One A love that should have lasted years.  You stay home She goes out She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone she doesn't need him Your day breaks Your mind aches There will be times when all the things you said will fill your head you won't forget her And in her eyes you see nothing No sign of love behind the tears cried For No One A love that should have lasted years.

To lead a better life I need my love to be here Here making each day of the year Changing my life with a wave of her hand Nobody can deny that there's something there  There running my hands through her hair Both of us thinking how good it can be Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there  I want her her ev'rywhere and if she's beside me I know I need never care But to love her is to meet her ev'rywhere Knowing that love is to share  Each one believing that love never dies Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there To be there and ev'rywhere Here there and ev'rywhere

I read the news today oh boy About a lucky man who made the grade And though the news was rather sad Well I just had to laugh I saw the photograph. He blew his mind out in a car He didn't notice that the lights have changed A crowd of people stood and stared They'd seen his face before Nobody was really sure If he was from the House of Lords. I saw a film today oh boy The English Army had just won the war A crowd of people turned away But I just had to look Having read the book I'd love to turn you on.  Woke up, fell out of bed, Dragged my comb across my head Found my way downstairs and drank a cup, And looking up I noticed I was late. Found my way coat and grabbed my hat Made the bus in seconds flat Found my way upstairs and had a smoke, Somebody spoke and I went into a dream.  I read the news today oh boy Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire And though the holes were rather small They had to count them all Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall. I'd love to turn you on.

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in And stops my mind from wandering Where it will go I'm filling the craks that ran through the door And kept my mind from wandering Where it will go And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right Where I belong I'm right Where I belong. See the people standing there who disagree and never win And wonder why they don't get in my door I'm painting my room in the colourful way And when my mind is wandering There I will go And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right Where I belong I'm right Where I belong. Silly people run around they worry me And never ask me why they don't get past my door I'm taking the time for a number of things That weren't important yesterday And I still go I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in And stops my mind from wandering Where it will go

Lovely Rita meter maid, Lovely Rita meter maid Lovely Rita meter maid, Nothing can come between us, When it gets dark I tow your heart away. Standing by a parking meter, When I caught a glimpse of Rita, Filling in a ticket in her little white book. In a cap she looked much older, And the bag across her shoulder Made her look a little like a military man. Lovely Rita meter maid, May I inquire discreetly, When are you free to take some tea with me. Took her out and tried to win her, Had a laugh and over dinner, Told her I would really like to see her again, Got the bill and Rita paid it, Took her home I nearly made it, Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two. Oh, lovely Rita meter maid, Where would I be without you, Give us a wink and make me think of you.
Picture yourself in a boat on a river With tangerine trees and marmelade skies Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly, A girl with kaleidoscope eyes Cellophane flowers of yellow and green, Towering over your head Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes, And she's gone Lucy in the sky with diamonds Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies, Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers That grow so incredibly high. Newspaper taxis appear on the shore Waiting to take you away Climb in the back with your head in the clouds And you're gone  Lucy in the sky with diamonds Picture yourself on a train in a station With plasticine porters with looking glass ties Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes Lucy in the sky with diamonds...

Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins Silently closing her bedroom door Leaving the note that she hoped would say more She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief Quietly turning the backdoor key Steppping outside she is free She (We gave her most of our lives) is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives) home (We gave her everything money could buy) She's leaving home after living alone For so many years. Bye, bye  Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown Picks up the letter that's lying there Standing alone at the top of the stairs She breaks down and cries to her husband Daddy, our baby's gone Why could she treat us so thoughtlessly Why could she do this to me She (We never thought for ourselves) is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves) home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by) She's leaving home after living alone For so many years. Bye, bye  Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away Waiting to keep the appointment she made Meeting a man from the motor trade She (What did we do was wrong) is having (We didn't know it was wrong) fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy) Something inside was laways denied For so many years. Bye, bye She's leaving home bye, bye
When I get older losing my hair, Many years from now. Will you still be sending me a Valentine Birthday greetings bottle of wine. If I'd been out till quarter to three Would you lock the door, Will you still need me, will you still feed me, When I'm sixty-four You'll be older too, And if you say the word, I could stay with you. I could be handy, mending a fuse When your lights have gone. You can knit a sweater by the fireside Sunday morning go for a ride, Doing the garden, digging the weeds, Who could ask for more. Will you still need me, will you still feed me, When I'm sixty-four Every summer we can rent a cottage, In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear We shall scrimp and save Grandchildren on your knee Vera Chuck & Dave Send me a postcard, drop me a line Stating point of view Indicate precisely what you mean to say Yours sincerely, wasting away Give me your answer, fill in a form Mine for evermore Will you still need me, will you still feed me.

What would you do if I sang out of tune Would you stand up and walk out on me. Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song And I'll try not to sing out of key. Oh I get by with a little help from my friends Oh I get high with a little help from my friends Going to try with a little help from my friends What do I do when my love is away (Does it worry you to be alone) How do I feel by the end of the day (Are you sad because you're on your own) No I get by with a little help from my friends Do you need anybody I need somebody to love Could it be anybody I want somebody to love Would you believe in a love at first sight Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time What do you see when you turn out the light I can't tell you, but I know it's mine Oh I get by with a little help from my friends Do you need anybody I just need somebody to love Could it be anybody I want somebody to love I get high with a little help from my friends Yes I get by with a little help from my friends With a little help from my friends
We were talking - about the space between us all And the people - who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion Never glimpse of truth - then it's far too late - when they pass away We were talking - about the love we could all share - when we find it To try our best to hold it there - with our love With our love - We could save the world - if they only knew Try to realise it's all within yourself no-one else can make you change And to see you're really only very small, and life flows on wit-hin and wit-hout you We were talking - about the love that's gone so cold and the people, Who gain the world and lose their soul - then you may find, pea-ce of mind, is waiting there And the time will come when you see we're all one, and life flows on within and without you

Day after day alone on a hill, the man with a foolish grin is keeping perfectly still But nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just a fool as he never gives an answer But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round. Well on the way, head in a cloud, the man of a thousand voices talking perfect-ly loud But nobody ever hears him or the sound he appears to make and he never seems to notice But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round. And nobody seems to like him they can tell what he wants to do And he never shows his feelings but the fool on the hill Sees the sun going down and the eyes in his head see the world spinning round. He never listens to them He know that they're the fools They don't like him The fool on the hill sees the sun going down And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round.

Words are flying out like endless rain into a papercup, They slither while, they pass, they slip away across the univer-se Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind, possessing and caressing me. Jai Guru De va Om Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world  Images of broken light which dance before me like million eyes, That call me on and on across the universe, Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letterbox they tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe. Jai Guru De va Om Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world  Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing through my open views inciting and inviting me. Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns, it calls me on and on across the universe. Jai Guru De va Om Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world Jai Guru De va Om...

The long and winding road that leads to your door will never disappear, I've seen that road before It always leads me here, lead me to your door  The wild and windy night that the rain washed away has left a pool of tears crying for the day, Why leave me standing here, let me know the way. Many times I've been alone and manytimes I've cried, Anyway you'll never know the manyways I've tried  but still they lead me back to the long winding road You left me standing here a long time ago Don't leave me waiting here, lead me to your door Da da da da.
Two of us riding nowhere Spending someone's hard-earned pay You and me Sunday driving Not arriving on our way back home We're on our way home We're on our way home We're going home You and I have memories Longer than the road that stretches out ahead  Two of us sending postcards Writing letters on my wall You and me burning matches Lifting latches on our way back home We're on our way home We're on our way home We're going home You and I have memories Longer than the road that stretches out ahead  Two of us wearing raincoats Standing solo in the sun You and me chasing paper getting nowhere on our way back home We're on our way home We're on our way home We're going home
