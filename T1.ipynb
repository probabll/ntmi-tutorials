    "\n",
    "It's wise to get an overview of the notebook before getting started, while the tutorials have been remarked as an excellent tool to learn the theory and how it connects to code, you need to balance your time investment. You can always do a first pass at a moderate pace and then revisit previous sections later, in case you figure they are needed for you to understand something else or for you to progress through a graded exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our notebooks also contain lots of useful tips for dealing with text and other forms of linguistic data, these may prove valuable in the future if you get to work with NLP tools. Besides teaching you the core elements of the course, we also teach you how to make good use of important tools in the toolbox of an NLP engineer, applied machine learning researcher, or computational linguist.\n",

    "For your covenience, we always list: the intended learning outcomes (ILOs), a table of contents, and a table of *graded exercises*. If you are taking this as part of the NTMI course at UvA, then you will find the assessment rubrics on Canvas.\n",

So, $f(x; \\theta)$ is *not* the likelihood of $x$ given $\\theta$. You can either say it is i) the probability mass of an outcome $x$ given a choice of $\\theta$, or you can say it is ii) the likelihood of $\\theta$ given a fixed data point $x$.

The term likelihood was introduced to contrast the quantity $p(x|\\theta)$ with the quantity $p(\\theta|x)$, which is the *posterior* probability density of $\\theta$ after observing $x$ (a quantity that appears in a Bayesian approach to statistics, along with another famous quantity, the prior probability density $p(\\theta)$ of $\\theta$). \n",
