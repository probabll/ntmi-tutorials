So, in practice we face text classification as a pipeline: we combine a *statistical model* and a *decision rule*.\n",

Note that we call $x$ a document, but it could be a sentence, a paragraph, or any granularity we like. A document $x$ is a sequence of words $x=\\langle w_{1}, \\ldots, w_{l} \\rangle$, or $w_{1:l}$ for short, where $l = |x|$ is the sequence length. Each word belongs to a vocabulary $\\mathcal W$ of known words, and the vocabulary size is $V$. \n",

    "As we said in the course, the probability of a certain sentiment $y \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ given a piece of text $x$ is not a real attribute of $x$ in the world. Rather, is is a quantification of the uncertainty that a *model of sentiment analysis* can make given text and given all of the design assumptions we made. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's **design** one such model. We will pick sentiment analysis as the example, but other text classification problems fit in the same framework as long as the target classes come from a finite set of disjoint categories (e.g., sentiments, or topics, or types of named-entities, or spam vs not spam, or product categorisation in online shops, etc). Technically such sets are called *countably finite sets*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal** We want a conditional distribution $P_{Y|X=x}$ that, given some piece of text $x$ (e.g., a sentence, a paragraph, or a document), quantifies our model's beliefs in each of the classes in the sample space $\\mathcal Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge** At this point in the course we only know how to model Categorical distributions using the so called *tabular representation* whereby a conditional probability distribution (cpd) $Y|X=x$ would require its own set of parameters which are unique to the outcome $x$ we condition on. As documents are really long, and there's no limit to how many different documents there can be in the world, we would have to store infinitely many distributions. Even if we choose to only store those for which we have observed some $x$ in the training data, we would face another problem, namely, we would not be able to classify novel documents (those never seen before). This is a key challenge known as *data sparsity*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution** We will model a joint distribution $P_{YX}$ over $X$ and $Y$ which we will factorise using some crucial conditinal independence assumptions, namely, we will factorise $Y$ first, as in $P_{YX}(y,x)=P_Y(y)P_{X|Y}(x|y)$, and then assume that words in $x$ are independent of one another when conditioned on the class $y$, which leads to $P_{YX}(y,x) \\overset{\\text{ind.}}{=} P_Y(y)\\prod_{i=1}^l P_{W|Y}(w_i|y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the *naive Bayes classifier*. It's called naive because the independence assumption is unrealistic (in reality words are not independent of one another), but they are useful to get to a feasible model. It's called Bayes because to classify a given document $x$, we need to infer the distribution $P_{Y|X=x}$ from the joint distribution, which we can do via *Bayes rule*, namely, $P_{Y|X}(y|x) = \\frac{P_{YX}(y, x)}{P_X(x)}$. The numerator is the joint probability, which we just defined earlier, and the denominator is the marginal probability, which we obtain via marginalisation $P_X(x) = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal Y} P_{YX}(k, x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then use a Categorical distribution for the prior distribution $P_Y$ and a set of $K$ Categorical distributions, one cpd $P_{W|Y=y}$ per class, for the class-conditioned distributions over the vocabulary. Specifically, this is the generative story:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Draw a class $Y \\sim \\mathrm{Cat}(\\boldsymbol\\phi)$ with $\\boldsymbol\\phi \\in \\Delta_{K-1}$\n",
    "2. Draw one word a time $W|Y=y \\sim \\mathrm{Cat}(\\boldsymbol\\pi^{(y)})$ with $\\boldsymbol\\pi^{(y)} \\in \\Delta_{V-1}$, until you generate a stop symbol (a special token in the vocabulary, used to denote the end of the document/sentence).\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter estimation then follows via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for Categorical distributions, and to avoid 0 probabilities for unseen words in the future, we use *Laplace smoothing* (or add $\\alpha$ smoothing)."
