    "In this section you will experiment with a strong pretrained embedding model that is very similar to skipgram, it's called GloVe. We are not using skipgram because the available models are much too large for this notebook, but GloVe is a **very strong** competitor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of training GloVe, which would be too demanding, we will download a trained one, and interact with it using `gensim`, a very robust python package for word embeddings.  We will experiment with the same applications that you coded above, but this time you will use gensim code, this way if you made mistakes earlier, they won't affect the quality of this experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is that you visualise biases that embedding models carry over from their training data. A statistical objective (like MLE) is *all about statistics* and not at all about *core human values*. When we download text from the web, it may contain all sorts of stereotypes that are inadequate in many situations. For example, if we download text with gender bias and train our models, those harmful  statistics present in the data will most likely be also present in our models. There's no statistical incentive in their training objective to get rid of correlations that we think are inadequate or outdated or simply harmful. For now, we will not work on fixing the models, we will just investigate them and see that the problem is real. If you are curious to see ways to address the problem, you can check this [excellent paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2016/file/a486cd07e4ac3d270571622f4f316ec5-Paper.pdf), though note that checking it is optional at this point."
